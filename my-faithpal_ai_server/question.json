    "question": "Is there any evidence for young earth creationism?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nInterpreting evidence is a somewhat subjective process because evidence can always be viewed from multiple vantage points. Police detectives examine crime scenes to determine the most likely perpetrators of the crimes. Sometimes the evidence seems to point in one direction only to later be proved to have been pointing in a different direction all along. Evidence rarely has only one possible explanation.\nOld earth creationists examine the cosmological and geological data and conclude that the universe is billions of years old. Young earth creationists admit that the earth and the universe appear to be billions of years old but contend that the data is being misinterpreted.\nMost young earth creationists believe that God created the earth and the universe with the appearance of age, much like Adam and Eve were created as adults. If a doctor had examined Adam and Eve on the second day of their existence, the doctor would have said they were decades old even though they were only created the previous day. Similarly, God created the universe and earth so that it could sustain life from the moment He created it. Therefore, it gives the appearance of having aged billions of years even though it is only thousands of years old. So, all the cosmology, geology, and other sciences that uncover evidence for billions of years are in fact pointing to the appearance of age that resulted from God creating a mature and stable universe capable of harboring life.\nMost old earth creationists reject the “appearance of age” argument and see it as unnecessary, even deceptive. Why would God create something that appears to be old when it is in fact young? Further, there are many phenomena in the universe with origins seemingly unexplainable other than by allowing for billions of years, and they are unnecessary to harbor life. The old earth creationists say that, if everything in the universe seems to point to billions of years, it should be accepted that the universe is billions of years old.\nBoth sides examine and interpret the same data. Young earth creationists see anything that points to billions of years as evidence for God creating the universe with the appearance of age or as examples of the scientific community misinterpreting the data. Old earth creationists see everything that points to billions of years as evidence that the universe is actually billions of years old.\nSo, whether it is continental erosion, subterranean fluid pressure, global cooling, lunar recession, helium diffusion, radiometric dating, the geological column, the big bang theory, redshift, distant starlight, etc., both young earth and old earth creationists believe they can explain the evidence in such a way that supports their viewpoint and/or refutes the other side.\nIs there evidence for young earth creationism? Possibly. Is there evidence for old earth creationism? Possibly. It all depends on which viewpoint is correct. In reality, all of the evidence points in the direction of the truth of how long ago God created the universe. It is a matter of us interpreting the data correctly.\n"

    "question": "Who was Epaphras in the Bible?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nEpaphras is mentioned three times in the New Testament, twice in Colossians and once in Philemon. He was a believer in Christ who served with the apostle Paul, who referred to him as a “fellow servant,” “faithful minister,” and “servant of Christ Jesus” (Colossians 1:7; 4:12).\nHis name and Paul’s comment in Colossians 4:11 indicates that Epaphras was a Gentile. We also surmise that he was from Colossae in Asia Minor, since his name appears in the letter to the church there and Paul says that he “is one of you” (Colossians 4:12). According to Paul, writing during his first Roman imprisonment, Epaphras was the one who shared the gospel with the Colossians and possibly started the church there: Paul speaks of “the day you heard [the gospel]” and reminds them that “you learned it from Epaphras” (Colossians 1:6–7). Epaphras traveled to Rome to visit Paul, informing Paul about the Colossians’ “love in the Spirit” (Colossians 1:8).\nIn his letter, Paul told the Colossians about how Epaphras cared deeply for their spiritual growth and maturity. Epaphras had committed to praying for the Colossians, “always wrestling in prayer for [them]” (Colossians 4:12). Epaphras desired for the Colossian Christians to stand firm in their faith and become mature. Paul gave testimony that Epaphras was working hard for the church in Colossae, just as he was for the believers in Laodicea and Hierapolis (Colossians 4:13).\nAside from the letter to the Colossians, Epaphras’s name shows up in Paul’s personal letter to Philemon. Like Colossians, Paul wrote Philemon during his first imprisonment in Rome. Epaphras had apparently been imprisoned while in Rome visiting Paul: “Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings” (Philemon 1:23). Tradition teaches that Epaphras eventually returned to Colossae where he remained a faithful servant of Christ and was later martyred. But those details are not found in the Bible.\nThe descriptions of Epaphras are significant: “our dear fellow servant,” “a faithful minister of Christ,” “a servant of Christ Jesus,” “always wrestling in prayer,” and “working hard.” The brief sketch Paul provides shows that the apostle thought highly of this follower of Christ and fellow laborer. Epaphras demonstrated a strong faith, a rich prayer life, a boldness in sharing the gospel even at the risk of suffering, and deep care for those in whom he had invested spiritually. Epaphras is probably not the first name that comes to mind when we think of Bible characters, but he faithfully served Jesus, and his reward is sure (see Hebrews 6:10).\n"

    "question": "Were the Salem Witch Trials biblical?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nA dark period in early American history, the Salem witch trials were a series of hearings and trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in the counties of Essex, Suffolk, and Middlesex, Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Hundreds of people were arrested, imprisoned, and tried for the crime of witchcraft, and nineteen of them were hanged. One was crushed under heavy stones, and at least five more died in prison. Numerous social, religious, psychological, and political reasons have been put forth as contributing factors to the bizarre events, but one thing is certain: the Salem Witch Trials were not biblical from a number of perspectives.\nSome proponents of this kind of action have pointed to Old Testament commands like Exodus 22:18, “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,” or Leviticus 20:27, “A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or is a wizard, shall surely be put to death,” as justification for the trials. They would say that, since God commanded death for anyone found guilty, then we are obligated to carry out those commands today. If that were the case, then we would have difficulty understanding what happened in Acts 19:19. As Paul ministered in Ephesus, many who had practiced witchcraft brought their books and burned them, confessing their sinful deeds. Instead of stoning these people, Paul welcomed them when they confessed and repented of their sins. Likewise, Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8:9 was not stoned, but was rebuked by Peter.\nWhy didn’t Peter and Paul obey God’s commands from the Old Testament? First of all, the Law was given to the nation of Israel as the basis of a theocracy. Israel was the only nation in all of history to legally and politically come under the direct authority of God. He did not originally establish a king to rule over them but declared Himself to be their only true king (1 Samuel 10:19). By the time of Jesus and the apostles, Israel was no longer a sovereign nation and could no longer carry out all of the laws God had given them. When Jesus was presented for crucifixion before Pilate, the Jewish leaders had to get permission from the Roman governor to carry out their plans. Second, in this church age, we are no longer under the Law but under grace (Romans 6:14). This doesn’t give an excuse to sin, but it does open the door of mercy to anyone who will confess and forsake his sin, no matter how grievous that sin is.\nAnother reason the Salem witch trials were unbiblical is the manner in which they were carried out. The historical accounts of the trials make it pretty clear that most of the accused were really the victims of mass hysteria, petty jealousy, or gossip. Little evidence was produced to verify the charges leveled, and that which was produced was hearsay or circumstantial. In most cases it was one person’s word against another, and once the charge was made, the victim’s word was rejected. Those responsible for the trials were in most cases probably guiltier of sin than those who were accused. Lies, gossip, and slander were the rule of the day, and God was certainly not honored in anything that was done there. First Corinthians 13:4–7 stands as an indictment on those who carried out the Salem witch trials, showing that they did not have the love of God within them.\n"

    "question": "What does it mean that even the dogs eat the crumbs (Matthew 15:27)?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nMatthew 15:27 captures the response of a Canaanite woman to Jesus. She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table” (ESV). Here is the complete conversation:\n\nAnd Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.” But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying out after us.” He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” And he answered, “It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed instantly. (Matthew 15:21–28, ESV)\nThe interaction between Jesus and the Canaanite woman might offend modern sensibilities. Some progressives, such as Brandon Robertson, have accused Jesus of racism for referring to her as a dog (Quintanilla, M., “Progressive Minister Suggests Jesus Repented of Racism in Popular TikTok Video,” ChristianHeadlines.com, 3/10/21). This is a case of eisegesis and viewing Scripture through 21st-century lenses.\nJesus’ statement, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs,” is a metaphor that highlights the prevailing sentiment of the time. The children represent the Jews while the dogs are the Gentiles. Jews considered Gentiles to be unclean and called them kuon (“wild cur”) primarily for religious rather than ethnic reasons. In the text, the woman is not offended by Jesus’ words; instead, she acknowledges the way she is viewed by the Jews. It is likely that she was familiar with the statement and the concept of the Messiah as a deliverer of the Jews. We should also note that Jesus calls her kunarion, a “pet dog,” which subtly deviates from the Jewish sentiment.\nHer response demonstrates both humility and faith. While accepting that Jesus came to feed the “children,” she asserts that the “dogs” (the Gentiles) need whatever Jesus has to offer, even if it is only in little quantities. Just as dogs eat crumbs from a table, Gentiles can also benefit from Jesus’ mission, although His priority at that point was the Jews. The Canaanite woman “did not ask that the ‘children’ might be deprived of any fragment of their portion; but taking her place, contentedly, among the ‘dogs,’ she could still claim Him as her Master, and ask for the ‘crumbs’ of His mercy” (Ellicott, J., Commentary for English Readers). The fact that she calls Jesus “Lord” and does not use a more familiar term like “Rabbi” is also significant. Jesus commends her faith and grants her request.\nJesus acts intentionally, so His initial refusal of the woman’s request served a purpose. His movement to Tyre and Sidon, a Gentile area, was also deliberate. Earlier in Matthew 15:27, Jesus had rebuked the Pharisees for prioritizing man-made traditions above God’s commands. He also demonstrated that a person’s heart condition is what matters, and He always honors faith. His interaction with the Canaanite woman served as a lesson for the disciples that even Gentiles can exhibit faith, further revealing that sin is what makes a person unclean, not traditions or ethnicity.\nEven in the Old Testament, Gentiles could be part of God’s people when they turned from their pagan ways and toward God. This was the case with Rahab and Ruth. Although God chose the Jews as His people, Gentiles were always included in His plan (see Isaiah 49:6; 56:6–7; Zechariah 2:11; Psalm 117:1). Jesus illustrates this through the response of the Canaanite woman, who showed that “the least of Christ is precious to a believer, even the very crumbs of the Bread of life” (Henry, M.,  Concise Commentary on the Whole Bible).\nFinally, Matthew 15:27 foreshadowed a time when Gentiles will not only pick up crumbs but also have a share in the meal of salvation. This was accomplished in Acts 10 and continues to happen today.\n"

    "question": "What is Willow Creek?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nWillow Creek Community Church is a large church with its main campus in South Barrington, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago; Willow Creek has several other locations in Chicagoland that feature live worship music and either live or video-fed teaching. Sunday morning attendance at all sites is approximately 24,000 each week, making Willow Creek one of the largest churches in the U.S. The church was a pioneer in the seeker-sensitive church growth movement.\nBeyond its locations in the Chicago area, the Willow Creek Association links a network of churches following the same innovative, seeker-sensitive model. The association is thousands of congregations strong, and it oversees the Global Leadership Network, founded in 1992, whose focus is Christian leadership development around the world. The Global Leadership Summit, held every August in Chicago, is simulcast to over 1,000 locations in over 135 countries.\nWillow Creek was started by a team headed by Bill Hybels in 1975. Hybels’ goal was to start a church that would be a comfortable place for unbelievers to hear the gospel. At Willow Creek, believers are encouraged to share the gospel with their friends and then to invite them to church. Every aspect of the church service is geared toward making unbelievers or “spiritual seekers” feel comfortable and accepted. The messages address relevant topics such as marriage, parenting, and finances from a biblical perspective without sounding “preachy.” Religious language and traditional religious symbols are avoided. The Bible is referred to but not preached from in an expository manner. The music, drama, child care, youth programs, special events, technology, and facilities are all of excellent quality. The primary service for believers is the midweek “New Community” service.\nWillow Creek Community Church’s doctrinal statement is solidly evangelical, and there can be no question that many have come to faith in Christ as a result of their seeker-sensitive approach. The conversion of Lee Strobel, a former journalist for the Chicago Tribune, is a prime example of this success. Strobel’s wife first came to faith through a group of women at Willow Creek. He saw the change in her and began to investigate the claims of Christ himself. And he began to attend Willow Creek with his wife, even though he was an atheist. Strobel eventually came to faith himself and later joined the pastoral staff. Today Lee Strobel is a pastor and well-known apologist, author of The Case for Christ and a host of other books.\nMost of the criticism of Willow Creek is due to its methodology, which inevitably leads to a focus on people and their needs—although the church would probably counter that people are what matter the most to God. For instance, the “worship music” at Willow Creek is carefully designed to appeal to those in attendance. Willow Creek also employs women as teaching pastors. Another problem that has been documented is that, although the Sunday service is supposed to be for unbelievers and the midweek service is designed to feed and teach believers, the majority of those who attend Sunday morning already consider themselves to be believers, and they don’t attend midweek service. As a result, many who are involved with the church are never exposed to significant biblical or theological content; rather, they are taught nothing beyond the practical application of Scripture to meet felt needs. Many attenders who feel the need for more biblical teaching seek out other churches to provide it.\nIn 2007 Greg Hawkins, executive pastor of Willow Creek, alongside Cally Parkinson, released the results of a multi-year study on the effectiveness of Willow Creek’s philosophy of ministry. The study’s findings are available in the ebook  Reveal: Where Are You? In summary, Willow Creek’s methodology was failing miserably at producing dedicated followers of Jesus Christ. Hybels himself lamented that Willow Creek was failing to truly help people grow and develop spiritually. Since their discovery, Willow Creek has placed a greater emphasis on Bible study and the teaching of God’s Word; although this emphasis is primarily applied outside of their main church services.\nIn 2018 Bill Hybels and much of the leadership at Willow Creek resigned due what seem to be credible accusations against Bill Hybels for sexual misconduct and the leadership’s failure to deal with the accusations appropriately. In February 2019 the church issued this statement: “While we cannot change the events of the past, we grieve what has happened, ask for forgiveness, and commit ourselves to pursuing healing and reconciliation.”\n"

    "question": "Is a wet dream / nocturnal emission a sin?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nWet dreams / nocturnal emissions are fairly common in the lives of men. The Bible mentions \"emissions\" in a few places (Leviticus 15:16,18,32; 22:4; Deuteronomy 23:10). Deuteronomy 23:10 specifically refers to nocturnal emissions: \"If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he is to go outside the camp and stay there.\" Many young men (and older men) struggle with this concept. Is a wet dream / nocturnal emission sinful? How can it be a sin if we have no control over it?\nUltimately, we cannot control what we dream about or what happens with our bodies while we are asleep. However, if we are filling our minds with lustful / sinful things during the day, it will likely show up in our dreams. A nocturnal emission is a natural bodily function that is made more frequent by sexual over-stimulation. A nocturnal emission is not sinful in and of itself, but it can be the result of sinful thoughts, desires, and input. If you have a wet dream / nocturnal emission, examine your thought life. Examine what sort of images you are exposing yourself to. If you find that you have allowed yourself to be \"inflamed\" by lust, confess that to the Lord and ask for His help in overcoming it. In such a case, the wet dream / nocturnal emission is the result of sin, not a sin in and of itself. Follow the words of Philippians 4:8, “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.”\nIf you find that the nocturnal emission / wet dream was simply the result of the body naturally \"relieving itself,\" you do not need to confess anything to the Lord. The Old Testament law was very ceremonial in its treatment of bodily discharges, for men and women. Thankfully, we are not bound by these regulations. A man who has had a wet dream / nocturnal emission is not \"unclean.\" Again, the issue is what is going on with your mind. The reactions of our bodies are the result of what takes place in our minds (Matthew 12:34-35).\n"

    "question": "What is Islamophobia?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nIslamophobia, as commonly defined, is an irrational fear or hatred of the Islamic religion or of Muslims—a fear or hatred that manifests itself in discrimination. The term Islamophobe is often used to smear anyone who disagrees with any tenet of Islam or who acknowledges that an act of terror might have been perpetrated by Muslims. Such usage is unwarranted, as not everyone who disagrees with Islam or who sees the link between radical Islam and terrorism is an Islamophobe; however, true Islamophobia does exist in society. There are people who do have an “irrational fear of Muslims.” A symptom of Islamophobia could be assuming that all Muslims are terrorists, avoiding Muslims altogether, or treating suspected Muslims (even if they’re Sikhs or Hindus) rudely or with disdain. Although Christians worship a different God than Muslims, followers of Christ must treat all men with respect (1 Peter 2:17). Christians should never be guilty of “irrational fear”; thus, Christians should not be Islamophobic.\nRomans 12:18 says, “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.” A person should never hate, fear, or treat with disdain any other person. Instead, all people, including Muslims, need to be treated with dignity, respect, and love because they are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Islamophobia has no place in a Christian’s life.\nGod has given Christians a spirit of love, not of fear (2 Timothy 1:7), and “there is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear” (1 John 4:18). There is nothing loving about Islamophobia. Christians are to love their enemies (Luke 6:35) as well as their neighbors (Mark 12:31). In the final analysis, even the most radical Muslim is not the Christian’s enemy. The enemy is sin. The enemy is the false teaching of Islam and its presentation of a false Christ who never died or rose again. Out of love, a Christian should be concerned that sin and error will lead all people to death unless they repent and trust in Jesus. We have been given the ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18), and we should seek to reconcile Muslims to the one true God, through the preaching of the gospel.\nTo fight Islamophobia, one can try to find common ground with Muslims. Although Islam and Christianity are quite different, Islam admits some things about Christ that could be conversation-starters. The Quran states that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary and that He performed miracles. The Quran acknowledges that Jesus was taken bodily to heaven. These glimpses of truth can be a point of contact between a Christian and a Muslim. A Christian who tries to understand what a Muslim believes can build more respectful relationships leading to dialogue. When the opportunity arises for a Christian to share the gospel with a Muslim, he should share the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). Irrational fear, hatred, or a knee-jerk discourtesy to Muslims only gets in the way of evangelism.\nChristians should strive to build relationships with Muslims and show them the love of God. We can pray for Muslims. We can get to know them. We can invite them to dinner. We can meet needs practically when they arise. There are many opportunities to counter the world’s Islamophobia with love. Muslims and all other people need to see the love and truth of Jesus. They can see this when Christians live out what they believe.\n"

    "question": "Why did God use a lying spirit to deceive Ahab?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nIn 1 Kings 22:19-23, there is a troubling passage in which we are told that God used a lying spirit to deceive Ahab. Does God really use evil, lying spirits to do His bidding? Why would God do such a thing? To find the answer to this question, we need to learn a little background about King Ahab, and also understand something about the sovereignty of God.\nKing Ahab was the son of Omri, and he reigned over Israel in Samaria for 22 years (1 Kings 16:29). Continuing the example of his father, Ahab did evil in the sight of God by worshiping Baal and “did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel than all the kings of Israel that were before him” (1 Kings 16:33). Ahab again and again proved he was bent on evil, evidenced by his continued refusal to listen to the prophet Elijah’s warnings. Ahab accused Elijah of troubling Israel by the drought, but Elijah declared that it was Ahab’s own sin that caused the troubles for the nation (1 Kings 18:18). Since Ahab had declared war on God by killing His prophets (v. 13), God then brought the war to Ahab in the form of a contest (1 Kings 18:19-40) between the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal on one side, and Elijah on the other. When God miraculously verified Elijah’s status as His true prophet, Ahab should have repented, but he remained in his sinful rebellion, fueled by the wicked anger of his wife, Jezebel.\nIn many subsequent incidents, God again showed His power and mercy to Ahab, but the king refused to submit and obey Him. Finally Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came to visit him and Ahab persuaded him to join in battle to take Ramoth-Gilead from the Syrians. Wisely, Jehoshaphat insisted that they seek God’s will in the matter, so Ahab brought 400 false prophets together, who all assured him that God would give them victory (1 Kings 22:6). Jehoshaphat recognized their falsehood and asked whether a true prophet of God could be summoned. Ahab acknowledged that Micaiah was a true prophet, but he hated him, because “he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad” (1 Kings 22:8).\nMicaiah was brought before the kings and delivered God’s final warning to Ahab. He said that if they went to war, they would be defeated and left without a king. Ahab replied, “didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?” (1 Kings 22:18).  Ahab was again rejecting the clear warning from God, and choosing a path of wicked rebellion. In response to Ahab’s constant choice of sin, God revealed some of the inner workings of the spiritual world.\nGod had already pronounced a death sentence upon Ahab (1 Kings 20:42, 21:19), but had given him opportunity to repent of his wickedness. With this final rejection of God’s counsel, God determined to carry out the death sentence. Since Ahab continued to prefer the lies of his false prophets over the truth given by God’s prophets, God chose to use the false prophets to carry out His plan. When God asked for volunteers to “entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there” (1 Kings 22:20), a spirit (fallen angel/demon) said he would be a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets. God gave the spirit permission to proceed, and Ahab received the message he desired.\nGod chose to use a lying spirit because Ahab rejected God’s rebukes and warnings all through his life and the cup of God’s wrath was full. Since God is sovereign over all of creation, He is not restricted in what or whom He can use to accomplish His holy purposes. All of creation is under His authority, and He chooses to use people and spirits, both good and evil, to bring His divine plans to pass and bring glory to Himself. “He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: ‘What have you done?’\" (Daniel 4:35). In the case of Ahab, God chose to use a lying spirit to accomplish His perfect and righteous plan (Psalm 18:30). The lying spirit will receive its punishment just as Ahab did, and those who repent of their sins will receive forgiveness just like Ahab could have. The real question is, “Will I respond to God’s warnings with faith and obedience, or will I reject His counsel and be rejected by Him?”\n"

    "question": "What does the Bible say about thankfulness/gratitude?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThankfulness is a prominent Bible theme. First Thessalonians 5:16-18 says, “Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” Did you catch that? Give thanks in all circumstances. Thankfulness should be a way of life for us, naturally flowing from our hearts and mouths.\n\nDigging into the Scriptures a little more deeply, we understand why we should be thankful and also how to have gratitude in different circumstances.\nPsalm 136:1 says, “Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.” Here we have two reasons to be thankful: God’s constant goodness and His steadfast love. When we recognize the nature of our depravity and understand that, apart from God, there is only death (John 10:10; Romans 7:5), our natural response is to be grateful for the life He gives. \nPsalm 30 gives praise to God for His deliverance. David writes, “I will exalt you, O Lord, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. O Lord my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me. O Lord, you brought me up from the grave; you spared me from going down into the pit. . . . You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give you thanks forever” (Psalm 30:1-12). Here David gives thanks to God following an obviously difficult circumstance. This psalm of thanksgiving not only praises God in the moment but remembers God’s past faithfulness. It is a statement of God’s character, which is so wonderful that praise is the only appropriate response. \nWe also have examples of being thankful in the midst of hard circumstances. Psalm 28, for example, depicts David’s distress. It is a cry to God for mercy, protection, and justice. After David cries out to God, he writes, “Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy. The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy, and I will give thanks to him in song” (Psalm 28:6-7). In the midst of hardship, David remembers who God is and, as a result of knowing and trusting God, gives thanks. Job had a similar attitude of praise, even in the face of death: “The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised” (Job 1:21).\nThere are examples of believers’ thankfulness in the New Testament as well. Paul was heavily persecuted, yet he wrote, “Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him” (2 Corinthians 2:14). The writer of Hebrews says, “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe” (Hebrews 12:28). Peter gives a reason to be thankful for “grief and all kinds of trials,” saying that, through the hardships, our faith “may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed” (1 Peter 1:6-7).\nThe people of God are thankful people, for they realize how much they have been given. One of the characteristics of the last days is a lack of thanksgiving, according to 2 Timothy 3:2. Wicked people will be “ungrateful.”\nWe should be thankful because God is worthy of our thanksgiving. It is only right to credit Him for “every good and perfect gift” He gives (James 1:17). When we are thankful, our focus moves off selfish desires and off the pain of current circumstances. Expressing thankfulness helps us remember that God is in control. Thankfulness, then, is not only appropriate; it is actually healthy and beneficial to us. It reminds us of the bigger picture, that we belong to God, and that we have been blessed with every spiritual blessing (Ephesians 1:3). Truly, we have an abundant life (John 10:10), and gratefulness is fitting.\n"

    "question": "What does the Bible say about communication?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe two most important types of communication are between man and God and between human beings. Communication is more than just our ability to talk, but also to listen. As we communicate with God, the first part of that communication is listening. God’s primary ways of communication with us are through His Word (Romans 10:17) and by the Holy Spirit (John 14:26). God speaks to all believers through the vehicle of the Bible, which is all we need to equip us for the Christian life (2 Timothy 3:16). In order to fully understand God’s communication with us, we must be diligent to read, study, memorize, and meditate on His Word. Trying to shortcut this process by seeking extra-biblical revelations or “hearing” God’s voice is not only unscriptural, but opens us up to the deception of our own fallen nature (Jeremiah 17:9; Proverbs 3:5) or worse, the deception of demons who are always looking for inroads into our minds (1 Peter 5:8).\nThe function of the Holy Spirit’s communication with us is first to convict us of sin (John 16:7-11), then to guide us into all truth (John 16:13). When Jesus went away, His disciples were greatly distressed because they had lost His comforting presence. But He promised to send the Spirit to comfort, console, and guide those who belong to Christ. The Spirit also “bears witness” to our spirits that we belong to Him, and thereby assures us of salvation (John 14:16; 15:26; 16:7). The Spirit communicates with the Father on our behalf, interceding and praying for us before the throne, especially when we are weary and downhearted and unable to pray for ourselves (Romans 8:26).\nOur primary mode of communication with God is prayer. We are to go to God in prayer for all our needs. When we lack something, God says that it is not from His inability to provide but from our lack of diligence to ask or asking with the wrong motives (James 4:2-3). Even Jesus prayed regularly because of the limitations He took upon Himself in human form (Luke 3:21; Mark 1:35; Matthew 26:36). No longer able to communicate with God face to face, as He did in heaven, Jesus prayed often and fervently to reestablish intimate communication with the Father. We are to follow His example and “pray continually” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). \nSecond, we must examine how we communicate with our fellow man. It goes without saying that no “filthy communication” should escape from the lips of a Christian, whether said in jest or in earnest (Colossians 3:8). James speaks clearly on this subject in James 1:19, “My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.” When we speak in anger, we fail to show God’s love. Whether speaking to a family member or a stranger, our communication should always come forth in a loving manner. Otherwise, our testimony is damaged, as is the name of Jesus Christ when His people fail to guard their tongues. The best way to be sure what comes from our mouths is pure is to be aware of what is in our hearts. As Jesus reminded the Pharisees, “Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.” If our hearts are filled with ungodliness, it will eventually come forth in our speech, no matter how hard we try to restrain it. Of course, our most important communication to man should be the fulfillment of Matthew 28:19-20 as we communicate the gospel of Jesus Christ to a world that desperately needs to hear it.\nBelievers should constantly examine their communication. We should consider the tone of newer forms of communication such as email and text messaging. We should never allow the safety of a computer screen to lead us to harsh or ungodly words toward others. We should consider our body language and facial expressions toward others as well. Simply withholding words is meaningless when our body language communicates disdain, anger, or hatred toward another. When engaged in conversation, as we prepare to speak, we should ask ourselves these questions: Is it true (Exodus 20:16)? Is it kind (Titus 3:2)? Is it necessary (Proverbs 11:22)?\n"

    "question": "What does it mean to trust in the Lord with all your heart (Proverbs 3:5)?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nProverbs 3:5 imparts wisdom to its readers: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.” There is a big difference between trusting in the Lord and trusting other persons or things. Our trust is not in angels or people or rituals or methodologies but in the Lord alone. And, as the writer of the proverb points out, our trust is not in our own understanding.\n\nTo trust in the Lord with all our heart, we must wholly rely upon God’s promises, wisdom, power, and love to help us in every circumstance. Human understanding is subject to error. God, on the other hand, sees and understands all. He is the One we can lean on and trust. We should trust the Lord with all our heart because human understanding is tainted by sin, limited wisdom, impulsive assumptions, and faulty emotions. We are not always right. Proverbs 14:12 reminds us of this: “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death” (emphasis added). Sin taints our understanding and leads us to destruction (Ephesians 4:17–18). “Our knowledge is partial and incomplete” (1 Corinthians 13:9, NLT). Should we base our understanding on what is partial, sinful, or destructive? Or should we trust in the God who is all-knowing, all-powerful, all-wise, loving, and has good plans to guide, satisfy, and establish us (see Isaiah 58:11)?\nGod does not change (Malachi 3:6), and His decisions are never capricious or evil. Psalm 92:15 tells us, “The LORD is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.” God is not evil and will not lead us to destruction. Instead, He leads us into paths of righteousness (Psalm 23:3). He never lies (Numbers 23:19; Hebrews 6:18), and He is faithful to keep His promises (Psalm 89:34). God’s plans are perfect, holy, and righteous, and He works all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). God is worthy of our trust.\nTrusting in the Lord begins by believing in Jesus for salvation. When we trust in Him, we acknowledge that “salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). We then get to know God more as we spend time in prayer and Bible study. The more we know God, the more we will love Him. The more we love Him, the more we will trust in Him alone—with all our hearts—for wisdom, for decisions, for everything.\nJeremiah 17:7–8 describes the benefits that come to the person who trusts the Lord with all his heart: “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, And whose hope is the LORD. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Which spreads out its roots by the river, And will not fear when heat comes; But its leaf will be green, And will not be anxious in the year of drought, Nor will cease from yielding fruit.”\nThose who trust in the Lord have hope and need not fear difficulty or calamity. They know who is in control of their lives and that He is fully good and true. Proverbs 3:5–6 is a wise instruction that ends in a promise: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;  in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.” What a wonderful thing to trust in God with all your heart and to have Him direct your paths!\n"

    "question": "What is pedagogy?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nPedagogy is the discipline of study related to the field of education and teaching methods. The word is derived from the Greek paidagogia—“to lead a child”—which was, in turn, taken from paidagogos or “teacher of boys.” In the Greco/Roman culture, a paidagogos was a slave responsible for the education of boys. Paidagogos is mentioned three times in the Bible, in 1 Corinthians 4:15 and Galatians 3:24 and 25; in those verses, the word is translated as “tutor” (NASB), “guardian” (NIV), or “schoolmaster” (KJV). The Law was our paidagogos to lead us to Christ (Galatians 3:24).\nThere are myriad theories as to the most effective method of pedagogy, and new methods are being developed every year. The Bible does not dictate a formal teaching method, but through direct instruction and inference, we can discover what God deems important about teaching.\nFirst of all, learning is the responsibility of several different parties. In Exodus 18:17–23 and 2 Chronicles 17:7, the nation’s leader and his representatives set up the education system. But learning is also the responsibility of the student (Ezra 7:10), and parents (Proverbs 1:8) and God (Psalm 25:4–5) see that teaching is done.\nThe Bible illustrates several different teaching tools used in pedagogy, including music (Deuteronomy 31:19), parables (Mark 4:2), and information saturation (Deuteronomy 11:19). Good teachers recognize who needs the basics and who can go deeper into the material (Hebrews 5:12–13). And, using Jesus as an example, teachers can know how to alter their information and their delivery depending on whether they’re addressing a large crowd (Matthew 5), a formal education setting (Matthew 21:23–27), or a small group (Matthew 13:10–17).\nJesus was the perfect teacher, a master of pedagogy. Our Lord used illustrations (Luke 7:31–32), object lessons (Matthew 6:28), current events (Luke 13:4–5), and stories (Matthew 13). He utilized lecture and discourse (Matthew 24), engaged His students in dialogue (John 3), asked rhetorical questions (Luke 18:8), dispensed proverbs (Luke 7:45), and turned questions around to force His hearers to formulate an answer (Mark 10:18). He preached and taught; He modeled and corrected. He gave “homework” and followed up on it (Matthew 9:13; 12:7). He appealed to the text of Scripture (Mark 12:26) and to the emotions, conscience, and intellect of man (Matthew 11:18; John 8:7; Mark 12:37). He was unafraid to use hyperbole (Matthew 5:29), metaphor (John 9:5), and provocative language (Luke 13:32). Always, Jesus had the best interests of His hearers at heart; always, the subject of His teaching was the absolute truth of God.\nGood teaching illustrates how the past applies to the present (Matthew 13:52) and is able to whittle down concepts to their main idea (Matthew 22:34–40). Proper lessons do not burden students with unnecessary requirements that aren’t relative (Matthew 23:13–29). Good lessons also don’t include false information (Hebrews 13:9) but teach the student how to verify the information (Matthew 12:33). They also focus on what is true as opposed to what the audience wants to hear (2 Timothy 4:3). When necessary, teaching includes rebuking the student (Proverbs 1:23), but the good teacher always takes an interest in the personal needs of the students (Matthew 4:23).\nThe Bible has quite a bit to say about teachers themselves. Pedagogues should be experts in their field (Mark 1:22) but willing to be corrected if it means ensuring they’re teaching the right thing (Acts 26:24–28). They shouldn’t lord their position over others (Mark 12:38), although they do have authority over their students (Luke 6:40). Good teachers are kind and gentle, not resentful or argumentative (2 Timothy 2:23–25) and are ready to teach anyone who is willing to learn (Luke 2:46–47). Good teachers teach with wisdom (Colossians 1:28; 3:16), practice what they teach (Romans 2:21; Titus 2:6–7), and aren’t afraid to teach the truth, even if it’s hard to accept (John 6:60). The best teachers instruct others how to pass on the truth they’ve been taught, so the cycle of pedagogy continues (Titus 2:3–5).\nPedagogy is important because teaching is a serious calling that comes with great responsibility and accountability (James 3:1). Teaching is a spiritual gift (1 Corinthians 12:28) and one that is a requirement for a Christian leader (1 Timothy 3:2). Christian teachers base their information on Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16) because they recognize the difference between human teachings and God’s truth (Colossians 2:22). Because of their position and responsibility, good teachers in the church are worthy of double honor (1 Timothy 5:17).\nWhat the Bible says about pedagogy is related to the integrity of the information and the teachers, not a complicated system to define the most effective teaching practices into a formal standard. Pedagogical theories aren’t necessarily wrong, and they may give teachers helpful information on reaching people who have different learning styles. The Bible’s guidance is simpler: know your material, care about your students, be creative, and live with kindness and integrity. The rest is just tools.\n"

    "question": "How can I help someone who is suicidal?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe threat of suicide is frightening and should be taken seriously. Many times, such a threat is merely a cry for help. Those with suicidal thoughts may be so distraught that they cannot imagine life improving, and they simply want the pain to go away. Suicide may seem the only alternative, yet the mention of it is often a desperate attempt to get the attention of someone who may be able to stop the pain.\nSuicide is sin, so anyone contemplating it needs to remember that (Matthew 5:21–22). Human beings are God’s creation, and none of us have the right to murder God’s creation, even if we make ourselves the victim. Suicide is telling God that He doesn’t know what He is doing and does not understand how hard life is. Psalm 139:16 says that “all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.” God sets the length of our lives, not us. Before we can help someone who is suicidal, we need to have a clear understanding that suicide is never a good option.\nWhen a friend or family member hints that he is contemplating suicide, we should urge him to see a doctor. Many times, depression or some physical problem may be at the root of the suicidal thoughts. Proper medical treatment may alleviate the suicidal thoughts and return the person to healthy thinking. Physicians can also refer the suicidal person to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment. Medication and talk therapy have helped many people abandon suicidal thoughts and return to their lives. A concerned friend or family member should keep a close watch on the suicidal person to make sure she is following through on the suggestions. Often suicidal people don’t care enough about their own lives to pursue help, so loving friends and family should step in and make sure the available help is utilized.\nWhen physical and mental health have been addressed, we can help a suicidal person by also addressing his spiritual state. If the person does not profess to follow Christ, her despair could be due to a lack of hope or purpose. A Christian can use this opportunity to share Christ with a suicidal person. When he comes to realize that his life has meaning and his future is in God’s hands, the need to end his life may vanish. If the Christian is unsure how to explain his or her faith, much help is available. Read with the suicidal person explanatory articles on becoming a Christian or being saved.\nSometimes the suicidal person is a Christian and has fallen into such a state of despair that God’s promises seem like fairy tales. This person also needs a medical and mental health evaluation and the presence of a caring friend or loved one. Despite our knowledge that what our suicidal friend is contemplating is sin, this is not the time to be judgmental. No one knows the depth of pain and depression that another is experiencing: “Each heart knows its own bitterness” (Proverbs 14:10). Empty platitudes such as “cheer up!” or “it’s not that bad” do not help. Often, the suicidal Christian is painfully aware of how wrong her desire is, which only adds to the despair.\nIt may help to empathize with the person, letting him know that he is not alone in feeling so low. Remind her that life comes in seasons, and she won’t always hurt this badly. A new and better season is coming if he can continue to walk through this valley. Direct her to the psalms that express the depths of human emotion. Read with him if he is too despondent to read alone. Psalms such as Psalm 6, 42:11, and 22:1–2, which Jesus quoted on the cross, help put into words our heart’s anguish. Remind her that Jesus knows what such despair feels like and He walked through it for us (Matthew 26:38). The suicidal person is not disappointing God due to feeling bad. Any condemnation is from the enemy, not God (Romans 8:1). We can gently remind her that despair is imagining a future without God in it, and He promises never to leave us (Hebrews 13:5).\nWe must keep in mind that, regardless of what decision a suicidal person makes, we are not responsible for it. Most of the time, family and friends blame themselves when someone they love commits suicide. This adds to the sorrow, but the blame is misplaced. Loved ones may have tried everything they know to do, but the final decision is not theirs. If someone is determined to end his or her life, there is nothing anyone can say or do to prevent it. We are each held responsible for our own actions. God does not hold us responsible for the choices of another. False guilt is the devil’s tool to steal our joy and future.\nIf you are considering suicide, please seek help now. Call 1-800-273-8255, the national hotline, get yourself to a hospital if you can, call 911, go alert someone in your home, apartment, or workplace, or wherever you are, and do whatever it takes to get help.\nNational Hopeline Network: 1-800-422-HOPE (4673)\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988\nBefrienders.org: http://www.befrienders.org/directory\nSuicide hotlines available in most countries: http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html"

    "question": "Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nIs salvation by faith alone, or is salvation by faith plus works? This is perhaps the most important question in all of Christian theology. This question was the cause of the Reformation, the split between Protestantism and Catholicism. This question is a key difference between biblical Christianity and most of the cults. Is salvation through faith alone or through faith plus human works? Stated another way, am I saved by trusting in Jesus, or do I have to believe in Jesus and, in addition, do certain things?\nThe works in addition to faith needed for salvation differ in various religious circles. Many groups point to water baptism as a work that must be added to faith for salvation—if you’re not baptized, you’re not saved. Some go even further: you must be baptized by the right minister, using the right method, saying the right words.\nOthers suggest different rites to be observed in order to be saved, but the formula is always faith + [fill in the blank]. Salvation is through faith + receiving Mass, faith + going to confession, faith + tithing, etc.\nMany passages of the Bible teach that salvation is through faith alone, not faith plus works. Ephesians 2:8–9, for example, is clearly worded and unequivocal: “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” Of great importance is the word grace, which refers to God’s blessings on the undeserving. The very idea of grace negates all attempts to earn salvation. Paul makes that argument when teaching on God’s choosing of the remnant of Israel: “Since it is through God’s kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God’s grace would not be what it really is—free and undeserved” (Romans 11:6, NLT).\nOther passages that clearly teach salvation through faith alone include Acts 16:31; Romans 3:28; 4:5; 5:1; Galatians 2:16; 3:24; Ephesians 1:13; and Philippians 3:9.\nThere are a few Bible passages that, at first glance, seem to teach salvation through faith plus works. One such is James 2:24, which appears to say that justification is by faith plus works: “You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.” This apparent problem is solved by examining the whole of James’ argument in his epistle. James is refuting the idea that a person can have saving faith without producing any good works (see James 2:17–18). Genuine faith in Christ, James says, will produce a changed life and result in good works (James 2:20–26). James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his or her life. The works are an outward show of genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26)—and it’s that outward show that “justifies” the believer in the sight of other people.\nPaul says those who have true faith in Jesus Christ will be “eager to do what is good” (Titus 2:14). To return to Ephesians 2, immediately after teaching that we are saved through faith, not through works (Ephesians 2:8–9), Paul says that we were created “to do good works” (Ephesians 2:10). Salvation comes by God’s grace through faith, and that faith is made manifest in good works. The works follow the faith and are a proof of it.\nIf we’re going to say that we are saved by works, we must qualify whose works. We are not saved by our own works, however meritorious they are in our own eyes. We are saved solely by the work of Christ on our behalf. His death and His resurrection are the works that save us. We receive our Savior by faith (John 1:12).\n"

    "question": "What does the Bible say about smudging?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nSmudging imitates a Native American ceremony in which certain herbs are burned to purify or “bless” a home in order to rid it of negative energy and restore positive, healing energy. People can be “smudged,” too. The practice of smudging is not mentioned in the Bible.\nSmudging is usually done with smudge sticks, bundles of herbs that can be purchased or made with sage, cedar, sweetgrass, lavender, etc. During the smudging ceremony of a home, the person smudging is encouraged to focus his or her energy and control breathing. After the smudge stick is lit with a candle, the person waves the smudge stick in the air, often wafting the smoke with a feather, and walks around the house starting at the front door and moving clockwise. Extra attention is paid to the corners of rooms (which supposedly accumulate stagnant energy). Once the entire house has been ritually cleansed, the smudge stick is extinguished at the front door. Some people leave the smudge stick outside the front door, thinking it has protective power.\nSome people also smudge themselves by directing the smoke around their body and through their aura. This is thought to cleanse them of negative or stagnant energy. Auras are the occult concept that human beings and other living things emanate subtle energy fields or fields of light, surrounding us like bubbles of power.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with burning incense or using herbs to beautify the fragrance of one’s home, but that is not what smudging is about. As with all New Age teachings, there is no biblical basis for belief in smudge sticks, auras, vibes, or household energy. The Bible tells us that God protects His children from evil (2 Thessalonians 3:3). We have no need to smudge; in fact, smudging is sin. We do not trust in pagan rituals but in God our Savior. God is the source of life, of all that is good and true. God promises, “The Lord will keep you from all harm—he will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore” (Psalm 121:7–8). He will provide the strength and peace we need to make it through any test.\nThe devil cannot be made to flee with smoldering sage; our refuge is the Lord alone (see Psalm 4:8). God provides us with powerful tools to fend off the enemy’s spiritual attacks (Ephesians 6:10–17). Smudging is not one of those tools.\n"

    "question": "What are the most common world religions?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThere are countless religions in the world, with most religions having sub-sects within them. Generally speaking, all religions attempt to help people make sense of their purpose and existence in this world, explain what occurs in the afterlife, and declare whether or not there is a deity, and if so, how we relate to this deity. The seven world religions in the list below comprise over 95 percent of the world’s religious adherents. With each world religion is a link to a more detailed discussion of that religion’s beliefs and practices.\nRoman Catholicism and Christianity\nThere are approximately 1.2 billion professed Roman Catholics worldwide. Though the Roman Catholic Church has always been identified with Christianity, there are clear and fundamental differences between the two. Roman Catholics generally identify themselves as Christians, but for the purposes of distinguishing the two divisions of the Christian faith, adherents of Roman Catholicism are referred to as Catholics, while non-Catholic adherents of the Christian faith are referred to as Christians. There are approximately 900 million people worldwide who profess to be non-Catholic Christians. The name Christian is derived from the fact that the early followers of Jesus of Nazareth were called Christians (Acts 11:26), which means literally “little Christs.” Christ is the Greek word for the Hebrew Messiah, the “anointed one.” Although Christians frequently identify with particular denominations such as Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Pentecostals, and Nazarenes, they also universally claim the name “Christian” for themselves. Christianity is oftentimes collectively called “the Church.” This is an indistinct term in that it is also the word used for local congregations and buildings as well as for specific denominations.\nIslam\nThe word Islam literally means “submission,” and, as such, a Muslim is “one who submits to God.” Islam is based primarily on the sayings of Mohammad, as dictated to his companions and recorded in the Qur'an. There are about 1.3 billion Muslims in the world today. Islam is represented all over the world. Though mostly associated with the Middle East, the largest Muslim populations are in Asia. Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India have sizable Muslim populations.\nHinduism\nHinduism is a word created by the Western world to encompass the dominant religious and social system of India. Traditionally, those we call Hindus refer to their religion as the dharma, which means “the way” or “the religion.” There are approximately 900 million Hindus in the world. Obviously, the greatest number of Hindus is located in India. Since Indians have emigrated all over the world, however, there are many Hindu communities in other countries. The total number of Hindus in India is subject to some controversy because it includes up to 300 million “untouchables” (dalits), who are officially counted as a part of the Hindu social structure but who are prevented from fully participating in Hinduism.\nBuddhism\nBuddhism is based on the teachings of the person called the Buddha, which means “enlightened one.” This religion has many different branches, but Buddhism is the only appropriate all-encompassing term, and its adherents, no matter how divergent in their beliefs, are happy to be known as Buddhists. Buddhism has about 360 million followers, placing it fourth, behind Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Buddhism originated in India. It is dominant in its more traditional forms in Sri Lanka and much of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia). Additionally, it has taken on various forms in many other Asian countries, most notably Tibet, Korea, China, and Japan. Today Buddhism is frequently adapted and adopted by Westerners, though often at the expense of faithfulness to the traditional forms of this religion.\nJudaism\nThe word Judaism comes from the name of the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve ancient tribes of Israel. So, literally, it is the religion of those who come from the tribe of Judah, who are (in English) called the Jews. However, being Jewish refers to an ethnic identity as well as a faith, and nowadays there are many Jews who do not practice the Jewish faith, even though they are happy to be known as Jews ethnically and culturally. It is estimated that there are about 15 million religious Jews in the world today, but many others do not practice any religion.\nBaha’i\nThe term Baha'i literally means a “follower of Baha,” referring to Baha'ullah, the founder of the religion. Baha'i has more than seven million members. Originating in Iran, Baha’i is represented in over 200 countries in the world, behind only Christianity and Islam.\n"

    "question": "Is the saying “to err is human; to forgive, divine” biblical?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe saying “to err is human; to forgive, divine” is not found in the Bible, so, in that limited sense, it is not a biblical saying. However, the sentiment may have a biblical basis, depending on the way one applies it. Since it is a “free-floating” proverb with no context, different people might interpret or apply it in different ways.\nThe modern saying has its origin in the work of English poet Alexander Pope. In his Essay on Criticism, Part II (1711), Pope wrote,\n“Ah ne’er so dire a Thirst of Glory boast,\nNor in the Critick let the Man be lost!\nGood-Nature and Good-Sense must ever join;\nTo err is Humane; to Forgive, Divine.”\nThe first phrase of the proverb, “to err is human,” is certainly a biblical concept. Human beings have limited knowledge and are prone to make mistakes. Even a person with the best of intentions can make a mistake and hurt those around him. Well-meant actions can make a bad situation worse. Scripture and human experience attest to the frailty and inability of human beings. Error is a quintessential human characteristic.\nThe second half of the proverb, “to forgive, divine,” is also a biblical concept. Forgiveness is not a natural human response to an error or injury. When a human being responds to an error with anger, he is responding with normal human tendencies. Galatians 5:18–21 lists the normal characteristics of a person living in the flesh, that is, living a normal human life according to normal human urges, tendencies, and priorities: “Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these.”\nA number of the sins listed in Galatians 5 are normal responses to an error. For example, someone is cut off in traffic. No malice was involved—one driver simply didn’t see the other car—but enmity, strife, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, and divisions result. These are all the opposite of forgiveness. To err is human, and so is responding in anger or trying to even the score. A corollary might be “it is human to err and then to deny, cover up, and blame someone else.”\nOn the other hand, when someone suffers from another’s mistake, the person who has been influenced by divine priorities will respond differently: Galatians 5:22–23 gives the contrasting responses of one controlled by the Holy Spirit; “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.” Likewise, James 3:17 speaks of “wisdom from above” that is “first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.”\nWhen a person commits an error, he is acting as a normal human being. When the person who was wronged responds with forgiveness, he is acting in line with divine tendencies. He is imitating the God who forgives. So, the saying “to err is human; to forgive, divine” does agree with biblical principles.\nSo far, we have only considered “innocent” errors, not sins where a person willfully harms another person or intentionally breaks God’s law. Galatians 5:18–21 contains plenty of examples of this kind of behavior in addition to the behaviors already mentioned. These are sinful “errors” in judgment whereby people think they know better than God about what they should do, how they should treat others, and what will make them happy: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, jealousy, envy, drunkenness, orgies. Sins are always errors in judgment and the result of unchecked human tendencies. To make these kinds of sinful errors that hurt others is human. To respond with love and forgiveness is divine.\nHowever, there is another way the proverb can be understood that would not be biblical. There is a popular sentiment that God is simply a celestial father figure or a doting grandpa in the sky. People err (they sin), and it is normal for God to forgive—that’s His “job.” This sentiment about God is expressed in the song “A Father’s Love,” written by Aaron Gayle Barker and made popular by George Strait:\n\nI got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye\nFightin’ was against the rules, and it didn’t matter why\nWhen dad got home, I told that story just like I’d rehearsed\nThen stood there on those tremblin’ knees and waitin’ for the worst\nAnd he said\nLet me tell you a secret about a father’s love\nA secret that my daddy said was just between us\nHe said daddies don’t just love their children every now and then\nIt’s a love without end, amen\nWhen I became a father in the spring of '81\nThere was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father’s son\nAnd when I thought my patience had been tested to the end\nI took my daddy’s secret, and I passed it on to him\nLast night, I dreamed I’d died and stood outside those pearly gates\nWhen suddenly I realized there must be some mistake\nIf they know half the things I’ve done, they’ll never let me in\nAnd then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again\n\nGod does forgive sinners, but He does not do it without justice. God’s love forgives, but His justice demands that the penalty of sin be paid. Romans 3:21–26 explains that it is only because of the death of Christ on behalf of sinners that God can be both “just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.” Biblical forgiveness is not based on sentimentality but on the satisfaction of justice. Believers who have been forgiven can also forgive others because they understand how much they have been forgiven. They can forgo taking revenge because they know that God will settle all scores in the end (see Romans 12:14–21).\n"

    "question": "What is the more excellent way (1 Corinthians 12:31)?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nFirst Corinthians 12:31 is the final verse in chapter 12, which addresses the topic of spiritual gifts and their role within the church. The verse states, “But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way” (NKJV).\nThe word but indicates that the verse is connected to what comes before it. Considering that verse 31 is the concluding verse, we should review the entire chapter to understand the meaning of a more excellent way.\nIn 1 Corinthians 12:4–11, the apostle Paul lists various spiritual gifts that are distributed to believers by the Holy Spirit (cf. Romans 12:6–8 and Ephesians 4:11). This list includes wisdom, knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, working of miracles, prophecy, spiritual discernment, tongues, and the interpretation of tongues. Paul states that the purpose of these gifts is to promote the general welfare of the church.\nIn 1 Corinthians 12:12–30, Paul uses the metaphor of a human body to illustrate the interdependence of believers within the Body of Christ (cf. Romans 12:4–5 and Ephesians 4:4, 16). Just as a human body is composed of many parts that form a cohesive whole, so it is with the Body of Christ. Regardless of our individual gifts or roles within the church, we are all united in one body through the Holy Spirit.\nEvery believer is indispensable to the function and health of the body: “The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you,’ nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’ On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable” (1 Corinthians 12:21–22). God designed the body in such a way that there would not be division, jealousy, or envy among believers.\nAfter discussing the various spiritual gifts and their significance to the body of Christ, Paul ends the chapter by pointing believers to a “more excellent way” (1 Corinthians 12:31). It is not improper to “earnestly desire the best gifts,” whatsoever they may be. Nevertheless, there is something of greater importance that should govern our pursuit of these gifts.\nThe “more excellent way” is the way of love, which Paul expounds on in 1 Corinthians 13. This chapter is often referred to as the “Love Chapter” because it beautifully articulates a biblical conception of love:\nIn 1 Corinthians 13:1–3, Paul argues that love surpasses all spiritual gifts. Even the greatest gift is empty and meaningless without love.\nIn 1 Corinthians 13:4–7, Paul describes the characteristics of love. These characteristics stress the importance of putting the interests of others above our own (cf. John 14:13 and Philippians 2:4). Hence, the purpose of spiritual gifts is to edify the body of Christ and glorify God.\nIn 1 Corinthians 13:8–12, Paul writes that spiritual gifts are temporary and will pass away. This section reminds us that spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and prophesying are not eternal. Love, however, is eternal and will never fail. Therefore, love is what truly matters.\nThis section also speaks to the limitations of human understanding. Because of sin and human finitude, believers can only know and prophesy in part (1 Corinthians 13:9). But when Christ returns, sin will vanish, and we will finally see God face to face.\nIn 1 Corinthians 13:13, Paul declares that love is greater than faith and hope. Paul made this statement because love is the foundation upon which faith and hope are built: we believe only in that which we love; we hope only for that which we love.\nIn summary, 1 Corinthians 12:31 reminds us not to lose sight of what is most excellent: love for God and love for one another (Matthew 22:36–40).\n"

    "question": "Can faith change God’s plan?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe short answer is that nothing can change God’s perfect, sovereign plan. However, God can and does give the gift of faith and work through that faith in individuals to accomplish His plan. So, from our human perspective, it often appears that our exercise of faith changes the way God acts.\nFor example, Jesus sometimes healed individuals and said, “Your faith has healed you” (Matthew 9:22; Luke 17:19). In Mark 6:1–6 and Matthew 13:53–58, Jesus is teaching in His hometown of Nazareth, and the locals reject Him. Mark says, “He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. He was amazed at their lack of faith” (Mark 6:5–6). So, the Bible contains examples of God acting (or not acting) in direct response to people’s faith (or lack of it). Does an individual’s faith change God’s plan? From a human perspective, it appears Jesus, God the Son, did something different based on the level of faith in another person. However, from God’s perspective, He already knew whom He would heal and whom He would not heal. In that sense, God’s plan was not changed.\nThe difficulty with the question of whether faith changes God’s plan touches on the larger question of God’s will and human choice. God knows all things, and He has a perfect plan. However, He also commands people to do certain things, thereby accomplishing His plan through humans. Also, God allowed sin to enter the world and allows suffering still today. These things are not part of God’s decretive will, but they are part of His permissive will. God’s ultimate plan for humanity, and the path He must take to realize that plan, is much greater and more complex than we can comprehend. There is room both for God’s commands for us and His foreknowledge of how we will respond to His commands.\nJesus taught, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, . . . you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done” (Matthew 21:21). Faith is extremely important in our walk with God (Hebrews 11:6). Even a small amount of faith can accomplish great things—not because faith is a special power we possess but because the object of our faith, God Himself, is all-powerful, and He asks us to trust Him.\nFaith is also important in salvation, but even the faith that saves us does not change God’s plan. God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4), and we are given faith as a gift (Ephesians 2:8–9). After salvation, we continue to walk by faith (2 Corinthians 5:7). And that faith-walk continues to accomplish God’s plan: “For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10). From beginning to end, God’s plan comes to pass, as He uses Spirit-filled, faith-filled people to produce His fruit in the world.\nHebrews 11 is known as the chapter of faith. This passage provides numerous examples of biblical characters who lived for God by faith. The author of Hebrews emphasizes their examples as positive models for us to follow. Despite their many struggles and difficulties, these individuals showed that God was at work through their faith in ways that changed their own lives and the course of history. Hebrews 11:30 briefly describes one event in Joshua’s life: “By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days.” Did Joshua’s faith change God’s plan? Did the marching of the army finally persuade God to act on the seventh day? Or had God planned to knock down the walls of Jericho all along? The biblical answer is that it was God’s sovereign will to conquer Jericho, and He used a faithful man and an obedient people to accomplish His design.\nFaith does not change God’s ultimate plan, yet it is an essential part of Christian living (2 Corinthians 4:18). Faith encompasses how we come to know God, how we live for Him, and how we share Him with others.\n"

    "question": "What are the Psalms of Solomon?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe Psalms of Solomon is a collection of 18 psalms, likely written near the time of the Roman invasion of Israel, around 60 BC. Scholars are unsure as to why this collection is titled using the name of Solomon, who died many centuries prior to its composition. The subject matter is similar to that of Psalm 72, an actual part of inspired Scripture attributed to Solomon, so the title might be intended as a reference, not a claim of authorship. The Psalms of Solomon is unrelated to the Odes of Solomon, an explicitly Christian collection of worship songs written late in the first century AD.\nThe Psalms of Solomon was written during the intertestamental period and was not considered to be inspired Scripture by either Jews or early Christians. However, the collection was mostly likely used in worship and for religious observances. Themes found in the Psalms of Solomon echo common assumptions about the Messiah, including an emphasis on earthly military victory and rescue from oppression. This work is the earliest known instance of the phrase Son of David being used as an explicit title for the Messiah.\nAs a collection of non-inspired works, the Psalms of Solomon is not to be confused with actual Scripture. However, like other ancient writings, it sheds light on the culture surrounding Jesus’ earthly ministry. The Psalms of Solomon is the likely product of a defeated, oppressed people. Israel’s desire for freedom and liberation factors heavily into the Messianic expectations of the Jewish people during Jesus’ earthly ministry.\n"

    "question": "What does the Bible say about keeping secrets?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nA secret can be difficult to keep and equally difficult to share. Yet life seems to run on secrets, from concealing birthday presents to obscuring a difficult past to protecting the whereabouts of an important political figure. The Bible teaches, indirectly, that keeping secrets can be either good or bad, but it does not clearly delineate the right and wrong uses of secrets.\nThe Bible shows that, throughout the history of Israel, political and military secrets were kept. Scripture does not pronounce any moral judgments for or against the keeping of those secrets (e.g., 2 Samuel 15:35–36). However, in the story of Samson and Delilah (Judges 16:4–22), Samson reveals the source of his strength, an act which, based on the aftermath of his admission, was awfully stupid. It was a secret he should have kept.\nEsther’s story provides a positive example of someone keeping a secret. Queen Esther’s decision to hide her nationality (Esther 2:20) became an integral part of God’s plan to save His people (Esther 4:13; 7:3–6). The same story also supports the morality of revealing a secret that, if kept hidden, would cause great wrong or serious harm (Esther 2:21–23).\nProverbs, the central book among the “wisdom literature” of the Bible, is the most explicit about keeping secrets. Chapter 11 says that “a man of understanding holds his tongue. A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret” (verse 12–13). So, keeping a secret can be noble. But secrets kept for the wrong reason earn a person the title of “wicked,” for “a wicked man accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the course of justice” (Proverbs 17:23), and “whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I put to silence” (Psalm 101:5).\nKeeping secrets of one type is always wrong: trying to hide sin. “He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy” (Proverbs 28:13). When it comes to our sin, God wants full disclosure, and He grants full forgiveness (Isaiah 1:18).\nOf course, there’s no use trying to hide our sin from God. Keeping secrets from Him is impossible. He is “the God of gods . . . and a revealer of secrets” (Daniel 2:47, NKJV). Even our “secret sins” are exposed in His light (Psalm 90:8). “For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light” (Luke 8:17).\nGod Himself keeps secrets. There are some things—probably many things—hidden from us: “The secret things belong to the LORD our God” (Deuteronomy 29:29). Jesus asked several people to keep miracles He had done secret. For example, Jesus healed two blind men and told them, “See that no one knows about this” (Matthew 9:30). When Job realized the immensity of God’s knowledge, he spoke of “things too wonderful for me to know” (Job 42:3).\nWe can conclude that God does not consider keeping secrets to be sinful in and of itself. There are some things that people should know and some things they should not. God’s concern is how secrets are used, whether to protect others or to hurt them.\n"

    "question": "Is Satan / the devil omnipresent?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nNo, Satan is not omnipresent. That is, he is not present everywhere at once. The devil is limited to being in one place at a time.\n\nBecause Satan is a finite, created being, omnipresence cannot be attributed to him (Ezekiel 28:15). Christ created all things (Colossians 1:16), including the devil—although Satan was not originally an evil being. Satan has boundaries and is not infinite in any way, including in his presence. Only God is omnipresent (Psalm 139:7–11).\nThe book of Job reveals that Satan can travel to heaven and roam about the earth (Job 1:6). Although the devil can go to different locations, he is never described as present everywhere. Satan and his demons do have abilities that humans do not, but they are limited nonetheless. The demons had to leave the possessed man of the Gerasenes in order to enter the pigs (Luke 8:33), and Satan is described as leaving Jesus in the desert after tempting Him (Matthew 4:11). If he left Jesus, he was no longer present with Jesus. It is evident that Satan is limited in space and time.\nBecause the devil is a deceiver (Revelation 12:9), he tries to make people believe that he is omnipresent like God. Satan fell because of his sin of pride and desire to be like God (Isaiah 14:13–14). Therefore, it is understandable that the devil would want to deceive humans into believing that he is present everywhere. It may seem as if Satan is present everywhere at the same time because of widespread spiritual attacks, but that is an illusion. Satan has numerous demons in his service who also carry out his schemes (Matthew 12:24; Ephesians 6:12). Charles Ryrie comments: “The very large number of demons may make them seem to be everywhere present, though that is not so. Yet Satan working with them can use their number to attempt to promote his plans everywhere” (Basic Theology, Moody Publishers, 1999, p. 186).\nBelievers need to be aware of Satan’s schemes and his desire to do harm (2 Corinthians 2:11; Ephesians 6:11). Even though Satan is a powerful enemy, he is not God and he is not omnipresent. God alone is omnipresent, and God alone is sovereign (Jeremiah 23:24; Psalm 115:3). Satan may be roaming the earth now, but one day he will be confined to the lake of fire, where he “will be tormented day and night for ever and ever” (Revelation 20:10).\n"

    "question": "Who are the Amish, and what are their beliefs?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe Amish are a group of people who follow the teachings of Jacob Ammann, a 17th-century citizen of Switzerland. It is a Protestant denomination, closely related to the Mennonites. The Amish, most of whom live in the United States, follow simple customs and refuse to take oaths, vote, or perform military service. They shun modern technology and conveniences. Transportation for the Amish is by horse and buggy. They do not have electricity or telephones in their homes. The men usually wear beards and pants with buttons instead of zippers. The women wear white head coverings and plain dresses, usually without buttons—they use straight pins to fasten the clothing.\nThe Amish believe that James 1:27 \"...and to keep oneself unspotted from the world\" means to stay away from things the \"world\" does—like driving autos, having a TV, going to movies, wearing make-up, and the enjoying the conveniences of electricity and phones. They often use generators to create power to run their equipment and use horses, instead of tractors, to do farm work. The bishop (leader) of an Amish community (district) sets up the rules of conduct allowed for his district. Some bishops are more lenient than others. The Amish have church services in their own homes, taking turns hosting on Sundays, and do not have church buildings. They usually only go to a formal school until age 15.\nThe Amish groups have problems, just like anyone else. Most of these church groups try to keep their problems concealed from the outside world. The youth are given the opportunity to taste of “the world” in their late teens to determine if they want to join the church. Many young Amish people get involved in drugs, alcohol, sex, and other vices during this time period while they are allowed to own a motor vehicle, but a large number then do give up the vehicle and join the church. Others determine they will not join the church and attempt to fit into the secular world.\nSpiritually speaking, the Amish are very similar to the traditional Jews that keep the Old Testament Law. They have a long list of do’s and don’ts. If they fail to keep the list, they are in trouble with the church and are in danger of being shunned. Shunning is a form of excommunication. If they partake of the \"worldly\" things, they are shunned by the church people.\nThe Amish believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, that He died for their sins, and that He is the way to salvation. However, many Amish also practice a works-based relationship with God. They view their good works as earning favor with God. If their good works outweigh the bad works, they feel God will allow them into heaven. The Amish are basically good, hard-working people, who have to make sure they stay on the right path, so they get final rewards in heaven when life is over. They say \"Amish is a lifestyle,” not a religion. They choose to keep the simple life so they can focus more time on family and home, rather than the things that require advanced modern technology.\nAs a group, the Amish do not believe in the security of salvation. They believe a person can lose his/her salvation if he/she strays from the path, or falls from grace. They do not believe in infant baptism, but do \"sprinkle\" for adult baptism, rather than immerse in water.\nThankfully, some (or many) members of the Amish church do believe that Jesus paid the full price for their sins, and have truly received the grace so freely given by God. Sadly, others cling to the “works-based” philosophy, believing their salvation is based on their “right” actions. The Amish set a powerful example by literally trying to \"keep themselves unspotted from the world\" (James 1:27). At the same time, the Bible does not call us to completely separate ourselves from the world. We are called to go into all the world and preach the gospel (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8). We are not to withdraw and separate ourselves from those who most need to hear the gospel message.\nThere is much for which the Amish are to be commended. The powerful example of unconditional forgiveness the Amish showed after the 2006 Amish school shooting was a demonstration of the love and grace of God. The Amish are kind, respectful, hard-working, and God-loving people. At the same time, the legalism and works-based faith that is evident in some Amish communities is not to be followed.\n"

    "question": "What are the books of the Bible?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer\nThe Holy Bible is an anthology of writings that includes 66 books in English editions. The Bible consists of two parts, the Old Testament and New Testament. The Old Testament includes 39 books, and the New Testament includes 27 books.\nIn the Old Testament, there are four major divisions of books. The first division is the Pentateuch, which comprises Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.\nThe second division is called the Historical Books and includes twelve writings: Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.\nThe third division is called the Poetical Books (or Wisdom Books) and contains Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon (or Song of Songs).\nThe fourth division is called the Prophetic Books and includes five Major Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel) and twelve Minor Prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi).\nThe New Testament also includes four major divisions. The first division is the Gospels, which comprises Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\nThe second division includes the Historical Book, the book of Acts.\nThe third division is the Epistles. These include the thirteen Pauline Epistles (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon) and the eight General Epistles (Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude).\nThe fourth division includes the Prophetic Book, the book of Revelation.\nThese 66 books were written over approximately 1,400 years by 40 different authors in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The writings were affirmed by early church leaders (Jewish leaders in the case of the Old Testament writings). The 66 books of the Bible are the inspired words of God that are used to make disciples (Matthew 28:18–20) and develop believers today (2 Timothy 3:16–17). The Bible was not created by mere human wisdom but was inspired by God (2 Peter 1:20–21) and will last forever (Matthew 24:35).\nWhile the Bible addresses many topics, its central message is that the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ, came into the world to provide the way of salvation for all people (John 3:16). It is only through the Jesus Christ of the Bible that a person can be saved (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17).\n"
